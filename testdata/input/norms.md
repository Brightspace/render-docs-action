# Foundation TLG Group Norms

## Inclusivity

We will be most effective when all voices are heard.
I believe this is especially true given the technical breadth of the group.
If a member is not feeling listened to, that is a failure for the chair to work to address.

Letting the chair know that a member is not feeling listened to will help accomplish this goal.

## Slack channels

We have two Slack channels:

1. A [private channel](https://d2l.slack.com/archives/GUE3BFR4L) for the group members to communicate and coordinate amongst themselves.
1. A [public channel](https://d2l.slack.com/archives/CVB0UU46L) for the group to communicate with others.  This will include communication from the group, e.g. announcements from the group; as well as communication to the group, e.g. questions or proposals from other teams or ICs.
